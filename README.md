# jslint

JavaScript syntax and style linting rules

For now, this is just a place to store rules and copy into individual projects.

I'm thinking eventually this could be an npm package which includes the rules and then each of my projects could reference the package (as a dev dependency) with a set version so that each project would just need to apply any overrides, but overall, there wouldn't be a copy of the rules in each of my projects.
